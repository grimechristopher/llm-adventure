# Core Philosophy

The game is heavily based on **facts** and the **interpretation of facts**. History and change of facts needs to be tracked and closely managed. Characters possess imperfect, potentially outdated knowledge about the world. The database must support:

1. **Temporal State Tracking**: The world changes over time; locations evolve, paths are destroyed or discovered
2. **Character Knowledge Divergence**: Different characters may know different versions of reality based on when they learned information
3. **Spatial Queries**: Efficient geographic queries for proximity, visibility, and pathfinding
4. **Emergent Narrative**: The LLM generates context-aware responses based on character knowledge, not omniscient world state
5. **Hybrid Movement**: Players can follow established paths OR travel freely through wilderness
